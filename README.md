# Community-Based Sarcopenia Screening Tool for Older Adults

This repository contains the source code, locked model artifacts, synthetic examples, and software-validation checks for the web-based screening application accompanying the manuscript.

The application was developed with Streamlit and is deployed on Render. It provides preliminary sarcopenia risk screening for adults aged 65 years and older. It is intended for research and preliminary screening only. It is not a validated clinical decision-support system, does not provide a diagnosis, and must not be used as the sole basis for treatment or referral decisions.

## Versions

- Locked model version: `1.0.0`
- Web application version: `1.1.0`
- Python: `3.12.13`

The model and web application are versioned separately. Interface, documentation, or validation changes do not imply that the locked model was retrained.

## Screening mode

Users can upload batch data in CSV or Excel format. The current release does not provide manual single-participant data entry.

Supported file types:

- CSV (`.csv`)
- Excel Workbook (`.xlsx`)

Each row represents one participant. The required columns are:

```text
ID, sex, age, EQ5D, pa_aerobic, is_allownc, Chew_Diff,
Prot_Deficiency, N_EN, HE_wc, obe_4class
```

`ID` should be a non-identifying participant code. `ID` and `sex` are retained for result management and are not used as model predictors. Detailed definitions and coding rules are displayed in the application under **How to Use** and **Model Info**.

## Output

The downloadable results contain the original input columns and:

- `model_score`: the model-generated screening score.
- `screening_result`: `Screen positive` or `Screen negative`.
- `recommended_action`: the next-step guidance associated with the screening classification.

The score is a screening estimate, not a confirmed individual clinical probability. A screen-positive result requires standardised sarcopenia assessment according to the applicable local protocol.

## Repository contents

- `app.py`: Streamlit user interface.
- `screening_core.py`: prediction, file-reading, result-action, and input-validation logic.
- `best_sarcopenia_lr_model2.pkl`: locked logistic-regression pipeline.
- `best_features_model2.pkl`: ordered model feature list.
- `best_threshold_model2.pkl`: locked classification threshold.
- `model_metadata.pkl`: model metadata used by the application.
- `examples/`: synthetic input and expected output files.
- `tests/`: automated software-validation tests.
- `supplementary_material/`: manuscript-ready interface screenshots generated with synthetic data.
- `VALIDATION.md`: software-validation scope, procedures, and temporal-validation results.
- `requirements.txt`: pinned runtime dependencies.
- `.python-version`: pinned Python version for deployment.
- `render.yaml`: Render deployment configuration.

## Local installation

Create and activate a virtual environment, then install the pinned dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open the local address displayed by Streamlit, usually `http://localhost:8501`.

## Run the validation checks

From the repository root:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

The tests verify locked artifact metadata, threshold behavior, input validation, recommended actions, and prediction parity against the synthetic expected-output file. See `VALIDATION.md` for details.

## Important limitations

- The model is restricted to its intended population and setting.
- A screen-positive result is not a diagnosis.
- A screen-negative result does not rule out sarcopenia when symptoms, functional decline, or clinical concern are present.
- Model performance may change across populations, locations, and time periods.
- Local validation, calibration monitoring, privacy safeguards, and clinical governance are required before operational use.

## Code availability

This repository is the manuscript-facing public snapshot of the web application. The files are provided together so that reviewers and readers can inspect and run the application using the locked model artifacts.
